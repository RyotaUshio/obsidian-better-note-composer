# Better Note Composer for Obsidian

This [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) plugin fixes some problems of the core [Note Composer](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Note+composer) plugin:

- [Heading/block links are not updated properly](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/note-composer-links-to-blocks-and-headers-should-be-updated-when-extracting/37534)
- Cannot undo extraction in the destination file

Currently, it only supports extraction of the current selection or heading.
Use the core plugin for merging notes.

## Installation

This plugin is currently available only via BRAT.
